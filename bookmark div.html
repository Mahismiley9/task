    <p>An image is a <b>visual representation </b> of something. An image can be two-dimensional, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, or three-dimensional, such as a carving or sculpture. Images may be displayed through other media, including projection on a surface, activation of electronic signals, or digital displays; they can also be reproduced through mechanical means, such as photography, printmaking or photocopying. Images can also be animated through digital or physical processes.

        In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).[1] In optics, the term "image" (or "optical image") refers specifically to the reproduction of an object formed by light waves coming from the object.[2]
        
        A volatile image exists or is perceived only for a short period. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode-ray tube. A fixed image, also called a hard copy, is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile.[citation needed]
        
        A <mark> image exists</mark> in an individual's mind as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept such as a graph or function, or an imaginary entity. For a mental image to be understood outside of an individual's mind, however, there must be a way of conveying that mental image through the words or visual productions of the subject. </p>

        <img src="./logo.png" alt="logo" width="200">
        <p style="background-color: brown;">A logo (abbreviation of logotype;[1] from Ancient Greek λόγος (lógos) 'word, speech', and τύπος (túpos) 'mark, imprint') is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or to include the text of the name that it represents as in a wordmark.

            In the days of hot metal typesetting, a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF Garamond), as opposed to a ligature, which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word.[2] By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged typeface or colophon. At the level of mass communication and in common usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its trademark or brand.[3]
            Etymology
            
            Douglas Harper's Online Etymology Dictionary states that the term 'logo' used in 1937 "probably a shortening of logogram".[4]
            History
            
            Numerous inventions and techniques have contributed to the contemporary logo, including cylinder seals (c. 2300 BCE), coins (c. 600 BCE),[5][6] trans-cultural diffusion of logographic languages, coats of arms,[7] watermarks,[8] silver hallmarks, and the development of printing technology.
            
            As the industrial revolution converted western societies from agrarian to industrial in the 18th and 19th centuries, photography and lithography contributed to the boom of an advertising industry that integrated typography and imagery together on the page.[9] Simultaneously, typography itself was undergoing a revolution of form and expression that expanded beyond the modest, serif typefaces used in books, to bold, ornamental typefaces used on broadsheet posters.[10]
            
            The arts were expanding in purpose—from expression and decoration of an artistic, storytelling nature, to a differentiation of brands and products that the growing middle classes were consuming. Consultancies and trades-groups in the commercial arts were growing and organizing; by 1890, the US had 700 lithographic printing firms employing more than 8,000 people.[11] Artistic credit tended to be assigned to the lithographic company, as opposed to the individual artists who usually performed less important jobs. </p>
